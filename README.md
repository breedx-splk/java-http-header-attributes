# java-http-header-attributes

We often get asked how to copy http request/response headers into 
OpenTelemetry span attributes. The java instrumentation agent does not 
do this by default, primarily because it risks leaking sensitive data.
Fortunately, there is a way to instruct the java agent to collect http headers. 

This project is quick demonstrative example of capturing http headers as 
span attributes.

The main application is `HttpHeaderAttributesMain`. This application spins up a small
HTTP server on port 8182, and a client that sends a request to the server once a second.

This is an unusual ab/use of HTTP and is only intended to demonstrate how to tell
the java instrumentation to copy a header into an attribute.

### Client request

The client sends a `POST` request with a `demeanor` HTTP header and the name
of the person in the request body.

```
POST /greeting HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 8
Host: localhost:8182
User-Agent: Java-http-client/11.0.9.1
Content-Type: text/plain
demeanor: TIRED

```

### Server responses:

The server responds with an `originator` header whose value is the uppercase
version of the person's name. The body contains the person's name and an 
emoji corresponding to their demeanor.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 15 Dec 2022 21:39:27 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
originator: BENJAMIN
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.4.48.v20220622)

## Running

To build and run the example, simply run the gradle build target `run`. 
You must have java 11+ installed.

```
./gradlew run
```

## Configuration

Configuration is provided to the java agent via system properties passed
on the commandline. 

If you look in the [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts) file, you will 
notice several JVM commandline args. These are used to wire up the java agent,
and to tell it to 
Add these system properties:
```
-javaagent:splunk-otel-javaagent-1.18.0.jar
-Dotel.javaagent.debug=true
-Dotel.resource.attributes=deployment.environment=http-testenv
-Dotel.service.name=HttpHeaderAttributes
-Dotel.instrumentation.http.capture-headers.client.request=demeanor
-Dotel.instrumentation.http.capture-headers.client.response=originator
-Dotel.instrumentation.http.capture-headers.server.request=demeanor,user-agent
-Dotel.instrumentation.http.capture-headers.server.response=originator
```

The last 4 are the interesting ones! These tell the agent which headers to capture
